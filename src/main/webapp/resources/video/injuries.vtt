<i>Injuries can be classified
into different categories.</i>

2
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.087
<i>A direct injury occurs</i>

3
00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:09.357
<i>when the body makes contact
with an external object,</i>

4
00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:13.690
<i>another person, or the ground.</i>

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.496
<i>For example, you can dislocate
your finger if it's hit on the end by a ball.</i>

6
00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:22.672
Direct injury is one that might occur,
such as a contusion,

7
00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:24.918
where when you're watching football,

8
00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.596
someone gets knocked
by another footballer,

9
00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.645
and they get a contact on their leg

10
00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:31.969
and they get a direct injury to that leg.

11
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.908
<i>An indirect injury is caused
by forces inside the body</i>

12
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:38.942
<i>such as excessive strain
on the muscles and ligaments.</i>

13
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.172
It may be when they strain a muscle

14
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:46.111
and they are swinging through
in the late phase of running

15
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:47.805
and they strain that hamstring,

16
00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:52.651
which we see so often
in football and hockey these days.

17
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.305
<i>Overuse injuries occur</i>

18
00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:57.378
<i>when specific body regions
are used over periods of time,</i>

19
00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:01.199
<i>particularly when the movements
are repetitive and low impact.</i>

20
00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:06.241
Some of the other injuries I've had
are bursitis, shin splints

21
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.881
and inflammation of some
of the ankle joints

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.899
as a result of all
the jumps training that I do.

23
00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:17.193
<i>A soft tissue injury is an injury
to any tissue except bone and teeth.</i>

24
00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:21.290
<i>For example, it could be
a muscular or skin injury.</i>

25
00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.362
During the season,
you've got calluses on your hand.

26
00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.017
Starting the season,
even after four weeks,

27
00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:27.986
you get heaps of new blisters
and stuff like that.

28
00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:32.753
<i>Hard tissue injuries are exclusively
injuries to bone and teeth.</i>
