1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.480
What is Biochemistry?

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.100
The Chemistry of Life.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.570
You know about atoms and molecules from Chemistry.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.150
But there’s nothing ALIVE about chemistry.

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.770
It’s just chemicals in a beaker.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.500
So what’s so special about the molecules
of life?

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.039
It’s a case of emergent properties.

8
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.130
That is, as biological molecules come together
and interact, new and surprising properties

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.210
emerge that you wouldn’t predict.

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.010
You can think of biology in terms of a structural
hierarchy.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.600
Atoms - molecules - cells - tissues - organs
- pretty soon you have a multicellular organism

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.000
with a metabolism.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.020
Let’s start with atoms.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.120
Especially CHNOPS.

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.180
Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus,
and Sulfur.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.510
These are the elements that make up 98% of
living matter on earth.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.840
We can study the behavior of these individual
atoms, but things get more interesting when

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.860
these atoms interact.

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980
Bonds are formed and broken.

20
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.660
We see the emergence of chemical behavior.

21
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.340
Some of these atoms stay bonded together,
forming biological molecules.

22
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.560
There are 4 main kinds of biological molecules:

23
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.060
Proteins, Carbohydrate, Lipids, and Nucleic
Acids.

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.440
Proteins are polymers of amino acids.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.220
That is, amino acids strung together to form
a chain.

26
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.729
These strings of amino acids fold into 3 dimensional
shapes that do most of the work of life.

27
00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.399
With proteins, and all biological molecules,
the key to remember is that the 3D structure

28
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.979
determines the function.

29
00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.810
Think of how a key fits into a lock.

30
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.660
The shapes have to be just right for the key
and the lock to do their jobs.

31
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.200
The jobs of proteins include structure, like
collagen, enzyme catalysts that control the

32
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.160
rate of reactions, signalling, like some hormones,
immune function, like antibodies and antibody

33
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.480
receptors...I could go on...all day.

34
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.140
Carbs (carbohydrates) are sugars and polymers
of sugars.

35
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.660
These are used for energy, and to build biological
structures.

36
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.000
Lipids are nonpolar molecules, like fats,
oils, and phospholipids.

37
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.160
These are important for energy storage, for
cushioning, and for structures like cell membranes.

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.720
Nucleic Acids include DNA and RNA.

39
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.880
These store genetic information.

40
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.140
It’s important to note these are all carbon-based
molecules.

41
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.700
This is why we say we are carbon-based lifeforms.

42
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.370
The skeletons of biological molecules are
made up of carbon atoms, covalently bonded

43
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.030
together in very stable structures.

44
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.620
Hanging off the outside of the molecules are
functional groups - small chemical species

45
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.750
like OH or CH3.

46
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.150
Think of the carbon skeleton giving biological
molecules their general 3D shape, and the

47
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.370
functional groups like flags hanging off,
participating in chemical reactions.

48
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.050
We see another level of complexity emerge
when these biological molecules interact with

49
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.670
each other.

50
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.710
We get enzymes controlling reaction rates.

51
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.330
We get DNA replication, and genetics.

52
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.360
We get cells.

53
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.000
And within cells, we have an incredibly diverse
set of chemical reactions that are controlled

54
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.090
and run at just the right rates to keep us
all alive.

55
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.040
That’s what biochemistry is.

56
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.120
The building blocks of Life Itself.

57
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.570

63
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.690

64
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.280
