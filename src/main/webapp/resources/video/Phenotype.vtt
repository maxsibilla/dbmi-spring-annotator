00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:01.120


2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.880


3
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.409


4
00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.940


5
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.259
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and welcome
to biology essentials video 33. This is on

6
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.410
genotypes and phenotypes and how changes in
genotype can affect changes in the phenotype.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.170
You should know what both of those are. Genotypes
are going to be the letters of the DNA. Or

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.760
the genes inside you. Phenotype are going
to be the physical characteristics that you

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.820
have. And so an analogy could be the letters
that we put in a book is like the genotype.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.270
But the story would be like phenotype. And
so I've written a sentence right here which

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.890
probably means nothing to you. Let's turn
to the next page of this text. And we'll see

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.899
that we now can see the word the, but still
doesn't really mean anything to you. But now

13
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.559
let's turn to the third page and we can actually
see a story starting to emerge. "The fat cat

14
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.870
ate the rat." And so the letters would be
like the genotypes. But the phenotype is going

15
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.969
to be the story. And so when you look at me
what you see is phenotype. You see that I

16
00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.110
have blues. You see that my nose looks like
this. But what you don't see are the letters

17
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.909
behind that. Now if you're really paying attention
on those first two pages, you actually could

18
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
have seen the message there. So let's turn
back for just a second. And so this is that

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.369
first one. And it doesn't make sense when
you look at it. And that's because the whole

20
00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.530
thing has been frame shifted. In other words
if I were to put a letter in right here. The

21
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.530
. . . you'll also see the fat cat ate the
rat shows up as well. And so this is a mutation.

22
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.470
If we ever have a change in here, so this
would be a deletion. So we deleted a letter,

23
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.119
it shifts everything over one. Or if I were
to go to the next one. What kind of a mutation

24
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.200
do we have here? Well, now we've got the but
now we've added this letter E. And so we've

25
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.670
inserted that. And so if I get rid of that
I can still see the fat cat ate the rat start

26
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.369
to emerge as well. And so changes in the letter
have huge implications when it comes to the

27
00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.920
story. And likewise, in us, changes to the
DNA can affect our phenotypes or physically

28
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.730
what we look like. Those are played against
our environment. And that's called natural

29
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.030
selection. And so let me summarize what I'm
going to talk about. Genotypes and phenotypes

30
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.450
and mostly how changes in the genotype can
affect phenotype. Now what are genotypes made

31
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.010
up of? They're simply made up of DNA. And
so how do we change the DNA? Or how do we

32
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.730
get errors in the DNA? Well there's essentially
two ways that we can do that. The major source

33
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.709
of errors comes from damage to the DNA or
mistakes in DNA replication. We call those

34
00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.660
things mutations. They're played against the
environment. And some of them are actually

35
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.950
beneficial. Some of them are harmful. And
some of them are none of the above. They're

36
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.349
neutral. There's other ways that we can get
errors in our DNA as well. We can have errors

37
00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.150
in the cell cycle. So when we're actually
making copies of cells or when we're making

38
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.239
sex cells we can have errors in that. That
can eventually lead to new phenotypes which

39
00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.410
can be good. I'll talk about bread wheat and
can be bad. I'll talk about a mule. And it

40
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.290
can also lead to human disorders. A famous
one that probably you're familiar with is

41
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.720
Down Syndrome. And so these are all simply
changes in the DNA. But those eventually cause

42
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.400
changes in the phenotypes. And so let me give
you an example of that. One of the most famous

43
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.530
ones that we always talk about as biology
teachers is sickle cell anemia. And so if

44
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.060
you have sickle cell anemia, this would be
a regular red blood cell like that. If you

45
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.810
have sickle cell anemia you have a red blood
cell that looks like that or this sickle kind

46
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.890
of appearance. Now it leads to a lot of other
problems within your body. But it's simply

47
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.670
a change in one letter. And how could a change
in one letter in the DNA cause this huge change

48
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.170
in the blood cell itself? Well let's think
about DNA for just a second. Let me actually

49
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.860
clear this off and get a better color. And
so DNA has two strands remember. This top

50
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.200
strand would actually be called an nonsense
strand or the non-reading strand. And then

51
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.709
this bottom one is going to be called the
sense or the reading strand. And so if you

52
00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.040
look right here, there's a G on one side of
the DNA. That means there's a C on the other

53
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.549
side, or there's a complimentary strand. And
so those three letters will code in messenger

54
00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.619
RNA. So this would be transcription right
here. Code for these three letters over here.

55
00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:30.339
Which codes for this one amino acid. And so
when you're making hemoglobin inside blood,

56
00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:36.029
that's how we get this first valine is going
to be this first amino acid inside hemoglobin.

57
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.249
And if we trace down, as long as the letters
stay the same, we're going to have the same

58
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.719
amino acids. But if you have sickle cell anemia,
you have a mistake right here. You have a

59
00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:51.330
mistake in this first amino acid. It ends
up changing the chemistry of that amino acid.

60
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.309
Therefore it changes the whole structure of
the protein and can lead to this sickle cell.

61
00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.099
And the interesting thing is that that's passed
on. Because that's what you pass on as your

62
00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.759
DNA to your kids, generation after generation.
And so that's been passed on and selected

63
00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.119
for or against. And that's how changes in
the letters of the DNA, any kind of mistake

64
00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:15.930
in this letter, leads eventually to changes
in the amino acids. Changes in the phenotypes.

65
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.099
So how do these mutations come to be? Well
we make mistakes. And so when we're going

66
00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.610
to copy one strand of DNA and make two. So
during the cell cycle, when we want a cell

67
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.819
to divide, DNA polymerase will make a really
perfect copy of that DNA. But occasionally

68
00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.999
it will make mistakes. And so maybe there's
a T over on this side instead of making a

69
00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:41.139
T it actually makes a C on this side. And
so we can get mistakes just from copying,

70
00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.139
or DNA replication in DNA polymerase. We can
also get mutations through radiation. Be it

71
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:55.169
like gamma radiation or UV radiation. That
can cause changes in the letters as well.

72
00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.199
And we can also get it in chemicals. And so
we find if something is a carcinogen, for

73
00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:06.199
example it's a cancer causing agent, good
example would be like diesel fumes is a carcinogen,

74
00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.159
but how does it make cells cancerous? It's
affecting their DNA. And it's making them

75
00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.929
so they keep reproducing out of control. And
so these are all ways that we can get mutations.

76
00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:21.559
And there are other ways we can get mutations
as well. But these mutations are then played

77
00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.990
against their environment. And we could group
those mutations into three different types.

78
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.979
If you've got a neutral mutation that means
we've changed the DNA, but it doesn't effect

79
00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:38.199
the organism. How could that be? Well remember
in eukaryotes a lot of our DNA actually doesn't

80
00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.289
contain genes. It's areas between the genes.
And so neutral mutations are not going to

81
00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.669
effect the protein or they're going to effect
the protein so little that it really doesn't

82
00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.619
effect the phenotype. Now the reason I put
a clock down here is that we can actually

83
00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:57.189
use these neutral mutations and we can make
what's called a biological or an evolutionary

84
00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.909
clock. Because mutations occur at a specific
rate. And so we can look at how many mutations

85
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:06.949
have arisen. We can actually see how long
ago it was that the two organisms, for example

86
00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:12.080
shared a common ancestor. We can also have
mutations that are then beneficial. In other

87
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.830
words they help an organism. One of my favorite
types of beneficial mutations, we really started

88
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.979
to study just fairly recently, and that is
mutation in the, so this would be in the helper

89
00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.869
T cell, it's in a protein found in helper
T cells. And so it's a deletion. So that's

90
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:34.479
going to be when we're missing a section of
that gene. And if you are normal your CCR5.

91
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:40.229
But if you have this mutation you have delta
32 mutation or a change in that gene. Why

92
00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:46.189
is it beneficial? Well if you have this gene,
or better yet two copies of this gene, you

93
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:53.189
can't be infected by HIV or human immunodeficiency
virus. In other words there's something different

94
00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:58.039
in the structure of that helper T cell so
this virus can't gain entry. What's interesting

95
00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:05.039
about this is it's most prevalent in Europeans.
We don't find it at all in Africans or Asians

96
00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:10.339
for the most part. And so that suggests to
us that it was selected. And so when scientists

97
00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:15.619
started looking they found that this offered
protection against either bubonic plague or

98
00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:21.550
small pox. And now is providing protection
for descendants of the people who first came

99
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.599
up with this mutation. And so it helped them
a long time ago. And it helps them today.

100
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:32.080
So that would be a beneficial. However, most
of the mutations are going to be harmful.

101
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.190
Harmful to that individual. And if it's in
the germ cells, harmful to generations that

102
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:42.019
come after that. And I wrote 70% and 7%. And
what that means is that if the mutation occurs

103
00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:49.019
within a gene, 70% of the time that change
within the gene is going to cause a harmful

104
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:55.269
mutation. If it's outside the gene, only 7%
of the time it is. An example of one would

105
00:08:55.269 --> 00:09:02.269
be PKU. PKU is an inherited disease. It's
a recessive disease, so you have to get two

106
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:09.629
copies of it. But if you have phenylketonuria
and they test all babies for this, you can't

107
00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:15.449
break down or you can't do well with a diet
that's rich in phenylalanine. And so they

108
00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:20.370
have to accommodate for that. They change
your diet. And so it's a harmful mutation.

109
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.889
And this was discovered just in the last century.
And so when we weren't testing for this, babies

110
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:30.810
that were born, their diet actually was killing
them. A normal diet. So that would be an example

111
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:37.680
of a harmful mutation. We can also have mistakes
not only in the copying or duplication of

112
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.680
DNA, but in the cell cycle. And so what I've
drawn right here is meiosis. Meiosis is how

113
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:50.420
we make sperm and egg. How do we go from a
diploid cell eventually to a haploid cell?

114
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.209
So you'd think of this making sperm or making
eggs. We can also have mistakes in here. And

115
00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:59.639
a lot of these mistakes will actually occur
during meiosis one. These chromosomes will

116
00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:04.970
fail to separate. And so eventually what you
get on this side are, instead of having ones

117
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:11.290
that are haploid, you'll actually have some
that could even be 4n or 3n or 2n on this

118
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:17.110
side. Usually when we have sperm or egg that
have the wrong number of chromosomes that

119
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:24.110
leads to a zygote that just doesn't go anywhere.
Or it's not viable. But sometimes it can lead

120
00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:31.699
to a new species. And so bread wheat, or the
wheat that we use to make bread, some of that

121
00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:37.680
wheat is actually tetraploid or hexaploid.
They've got extra sets of chromosomes. And

122
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.579
that can actually lead to vigor. In plants,
a large number of plants are actually made

123
00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:51.579
through mistakes in the DNA. Mistakes in the
cell cycle. It can also lead to sterility.

124
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:58.889
And so you probably know that a mule is when
you have a female donkey and a male horse.

125
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:05.329
And they're sterile. And the reason why is
that a male horse is going to have 64 chromosomes.

126
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:10.490
And donkey is going to have 62 chromosomes.
And so a mule is going to have 63 or an odd

127
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.230
number of chromosomes. It's hard for them
to make a viable sperm or egg. I think there

128
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.850
has been one case of a female, a few cases
of female mules actually giving birth to foals.

129
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.360
But it's really, really rare. And so that
can lead to sterility. It can also, these

130
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.889
changes in meiosis can lead to disorders.
A famous example of that is the Down Syndrome.

131
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:35.040
And so this would be a karyotype or a picture
of all the chromosomes in an individual. In

132
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.910
this case it would be a female because there
are two X chromosomes. But it you look at

133
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.379
here, with an individual who has Down Syndrome,
you'll notice that they actually had three

134
00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:49.149
21st chromosomes. Now what does that lead
to? A lot of the characteristics of a person

135
00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:54.499
who has Down Syndrome, development is going
to be slow. Sometimes they'll have a problem

136
00:11:54.499 --> 00:11:58.170
with speech. And the reason why is that a
lot of those things are linked to proteins

137
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.649
that are on the 21st chromosome. It's not
a disorder. If you know somebody who has Down

138
00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:07.779
Syndrome, they live a really normal life and
they can be some of the best people you ever

139
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:13.490
meet. But mistakes in this can eventually
lead to genetic problems. On this map right

140
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.980
here I'm showing how natural selection is
actually played out. And so at the beginning

141
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:23.300
remember I was talking about hemoglobin and
how sickle cell anemia can lead to awful things.

142
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.519
The neat thing that it can lead to is also
the ability to not get malaria. And so this

143
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:33.189
map on the left side is where malarial mosquitoes
are found. On the right side it shows the

144
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:39.009
incidence of sickle cell anemia. And so we're
going to find a higher rate of sickle cell

145
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:45.350
anemia in especially sub-Saharan Africa. And
the reason why is that it created sickle cell

146
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.360
anemia which was bad, but the beneficial mutation
has allowed them not to get malaria, which

147
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.889
is a huge selective pressure in Africa. And
so that's genotypes. That's phenotypes. And

148
00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:56.559
I hope that's helpful.
